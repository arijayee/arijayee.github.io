    <p style="color:white;margin: 0.2in;font-size:30px;font-weight: 500;">Conclusion</p>
    <p>
      Considering that the Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.15976, I can conclude that there is not a positive, statistically significant correlation between global warming and natural disasters in the years of 2006-2015. In fact, it appears that there is no relationship at all.

    <p>
      Although the data collected is credible, it is also important to consider that the data tested is only in a span of 10 years. 10 years is just a smaller part of the bigger picture. In order to truly asses them impact of climate change, the time span needs greater than 10 years. The earth's temperature has increased over a series of centruies. Since time and resources were limited in this study, I couldn't do a full analysis of the earth's temperature and number of natural disasters over the span of multiple centuries.

    <p style="color:white;margin: 0.2in;font-size:30px;font-weight: 500;"> So...What Are The Next Steps? </p>
    <p>
      The next steps would be:<br>
      1. Collect data from multiple time periods!<br>
      2. Find the root of climate change, is it anthropogenic, natural, or<br> something else?<br>
      3. Collect more data on how helpful things like using electric cars , living in homes powered by solar energy, or biking to work everyday are to Global Warming. This data can be used to encourage people to use less energy throughout their daily lives.<br>
