    <p style="color:white;margin: 0.2in;font-size:30px;font-weight: 500;">Conclusion</p>
    <p>
      Considering that the Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.15976, I can conclude that there is not a positive, statistically significant correlation between global warming<br> and natural disasters in the years of 2006-2015. In fact, it appears that there is no relationship at all.

    <p>
      Although the data collected is credible, it is also important to consider that the data tested is only in a span of 10 years. 10 years is just a smaller part of the bigger picture. <br> In order to truly asses them impact of climate change, the time span needs greater than 10 years. The earth's temperature has increased over a series of centruies.<br> Since time and resources were limited in this study, I couldn't do a full analysis of the earth's temperature and number of natural disasters over the span of multiple centuries.

    <p style="color:white;margin: 0.2in;font-size:30px;font-weight: 500;"> So...What Are The Next Steps? </p>
    <p>
      The next steps would be:<br>
      1. Collect data from multiple time periods!<br>
      2. Find the root of climate change, is it anthropogenic, natural, or<br> something else?<br>
      3. Collect more data on how helpful things like using electric cars , living in homes powered by solar energy, or biking to work everyday are to Global Warming. This data<br> can be used to encourage people to use less energy throughout their daily lives.<br>
