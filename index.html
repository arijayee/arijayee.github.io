      <p> Is there a positive, statistically significant correlation between the number of followers an influencer has and their influence score?</p> 
      
      <p>   The popular app known as “Instagram” hosts a variety of people who want to connect, teach, and share with others. Many people who don’t have a lot of followers but make a significant impact on others tend not to get the same amount of recognition that people with a lot of followers get. 
      While considering this, we asked a question; is there a positive, statistically significant correlation between the number of followers an influencer has and their influence score? By using data from a database that describes the number of followers one has and their influence score, we discovered that the average number of followers is 85,201,459 million. 
      The average for their influence score is 8.1 million. The mode for followers is 3,3600,000, and the mode for influence score is 85. The median for followers is 53,300,000, and the median for the influence score is 83.0. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is 0.442241. 
      With the Pearson Correlation Coefficient being less than 0.5, I conclude that there is no positive statistically significant relationship between the number of followers an influencer has and their influence score. 
      In fact, there is no statistically significant relationship at all. The validity of these findings may be compromised considering that they only analyzed 200 out of 3.2 million influencers on Instagram. </p>

      <p> Is there a positive, statistically significant correlation between the average likes an influencer has on a post and their influence score? </p> 
      <p> Instagram is a space that allows people to share important information or teach others about something one is truly passionate about. Although instagram is meant to be an inclusive environment, more and more information is coming out that it may not be an equal playing field.
      In order to figure out what variables make this an unfair place for people I conducted a study seeing if there is a positive, statistically significant correlation between the average likes an influencer has on a post and their influence score. 
      The mean for the influence score is 8.1 million, and the mean for the total number of likes is 4,267,624,000 billion. The median for the influence score is 8,300,000 and the median for total number of likes is 8,300,000,000 billion. 
      Lastly, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient is 0.295035. Considering that the Pearson Correlation Coefficient is less than 0.5, I conclude that there is not a positive, statistically significant correlation between the average likes and influencer has on a post and their influence score. 
      Moreover, there is not a statistically significant relationship between the two variables at all. </p>

      <p> Is there a positive, statistically significant correlation between the total number of likes an influencer has and their influence score? </p> 
      
      <p> Instagram is a place strictly dominated by likes and followers.  Does the total amount of likes a person has determine their influence score? To be more specific, is there a positive, statistically significant correlation between the total number of likes an influencer has and their influence score? In order to answer this question I collected date on the mean, median, mode, and the Pearson correlation coefficient. The mean for the influence score is 8.1 million; the mean for the Total Likes is 4,267,624,000 billion. The mode for the influence score is 1,500,000,000 and the mode for the total likes is 1,800,000,000. The median for influencer score is 8,300,000 and the median for the total likes is 2,400,000,000. Lastly, the Pearson Correlation Coefficent is 0.295035. With the correlation being less than 0.5, I conclude that there is not a positive, statistically significant correlation between total likes and influence score. </p>

      <p> Is there a positive, statistically significant. correlation between the number of posts an influencer has made and their influence score? </p> 
      <p> To further the research on what determines a persons influence score, we assessed the relationship between the number of posts and influencer has made and their influence score. To be more specific, we asked; is there a positive, statistically significant correlation between the number of posts an influencer has made and their influence score. To asses this we studied the mean, median, and mode as well as the Pearson Correlation Coeffiencent. The mean for influence score is 81.68 and the mean for posts is 3986.0948. The median for influence score is 83.0 and the median for posts is 3,000. The mode for influence score is 85 anf the mode for posts is 10,000. Lastly, the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.17408. With the correlation coefficient being less than 0.5, I conclude that there is not a positive statistically significant relationship between posts and influence score. Moreover, there is no relationship between the two variables at all. </p>

      <h1> Conclusions and Findings </h1> 
      
      <p> After a deep Analysis of this data, I can conclude that there is no correlation between the number of followers, total number of likes, average number of likes, number of posts and the influence score. The threat to validity of this data is that only 200 of 3.2 billion influecers on instagram were analyzed meaning that we only have a little bit of the bigger picture. </p>
